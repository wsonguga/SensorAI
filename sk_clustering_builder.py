  """K-Means clustering.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <k_means>`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'
        Method for initialization:

        'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centroids using sampling based on
        an empirical probability distribution of the points' contribution to the
        overall inertia. This technique speeds up convergence. The algorithm
        implemented is "greedy k-means++". It differs from the vanilla k-means++
        by making several trials at each sampling step and choosing the best centroid
        among them.

        'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
        for the initial centroids.

        If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        and gives the initial centers.

        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
        random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : 'auto' or int, default=10
        Number of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid
        seeds. The final results is the best output of `n_init` consecutive runs
        in terms of inertia. Several runs are recommended for sparse
        high-dimensional problems (see :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).

        When `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:
        10 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;
        1 if using `init='k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           Added 'auto' option for `n_init`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4
           Default value for `n_init` will change from 10 to `'auto'` in version 1.4.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a
        single run.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
        convergence.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd", "elkan", "auto", "full"}, default="lloyd"
        K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.

        `"auto"` and `"full"` are deprecated and they will be removed in
        Scikit-Learn 1.3. They are both aliases for `"lloyd"`.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
            Added Elkan algorithm

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            Renamed "full" to "lloyd", and deprecated "auto" and "full".
            Changed "auto" to use "lloyd" instead of "elkan".

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers. If the algorithm stops before fully
        converging (see ``tol`` and ``max_iter``), these will not be
        consistent with ``labels_``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point

    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center,
        weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8

        'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean

        Notes in k_init for more details.

        'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
        for the initial centroids.

        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a

    n_init : int, default=1
        Number of time the inner k-means algorithm will be run with different

        That will result producing for each bisection best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization
        in inner K-Means. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the inner k-means algorithm at each
        bisection.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations  to declare
        convergence. Used in inner k-means algorithm at each bisection to pick
        best possible clusters.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back

        copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd", "elkan"}, default="lloyd"
        Inner K-means algorithm used in bisection.
        The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's

    bisecting_strategy : {"biggest_inertia", "largest_cluster"},\
            default="biggest_inertia"
        Defines how bisection should be performed:

         - "biggest_inertia" means that BisectingKMeans will always check
            all calculated cluster for cluster with biggest SSE
            (Sum of squared errors) and bisect it. This approach concentrates on
            precision, but may be costly in terms of execution time (especially for
            larger amount of data points).

         - "largest_cluster" - BisectingKMeans will always split cluster with
            largest amount of points assigned to it from all clusters
            previously calculated. That should work faster than picking by SSE
            ('biggest_inertia') and may produce similar results in most cases.

    ----------

    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'

        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
        random state and return an initialization.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations over the complete dataset before
        stopping independently of any early stopping criterion heuristics.

    batch_size : int, default=1024
        Size of the mini batches.
        For faster computations, you can set the ``batch_size`` greater than
        256 * number of cores to enable parallelism on all cores.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0
           `batch_size` default changed from 100 to 1024.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    compute_labels : bool, default=True
        Compute label assignment and inertia for the complete dataset
        once the minibatch optimization has converged in fit.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization and
        random reassignment. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    tol : float, default=0.0
        Control early stopping based on the relative center changes as
        measured by a smoothed, variance-normalized of the mean center
        squared position changes. This early stopping heuristics is
        closer to the one used for the batch variant of the algorithms
        but induces a slight computational and memory overhead over the
        inertia heuristic.

        To disable convergence detection based on normalized center
        change, set tol to 0.0 (default).

    max_no_improvement : int, default=10
        Control early stopping based on the consecutive number of mini
        batches that does not yield an improvement on the smoothed inertia.

        To disable convergence detection based on inertia, set
        max_no_improvement to None.

    init_size : int, default=None
        Number of samples to randomly sample for speeding up the
        initialization (sometimes at the expense of accuracy): the
        only algorithm is initialized by running a batch KMeans on a
        random subset of the data. This needs to be larger than n_clusters.

        If `None`, the heuristic is `init_size = 3 * batch_size` if
        `3 * batch_size < n_clusters`, else `init_size = 3 * n_clusters`.

    n_init : 'auto' or int, default=3
        Number of random initializations that are tried.
        In contrast to KMeans, the algorithm is only run once, using the best of
        the `n_init` initializations as measured by inertia. Several runs are
        recommended for sparse high-dimensional problems (see
        :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).

        When `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:
        3 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;
        1 if using `init='k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           Added 'auto' option for `n_init`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4
           Default value for `n_init` will change from 3 to `'auto'` in version 1.4.

    reassignment_ratio : float, default=0.01
        Control the fraction of the maximum number of counts for a center to
        be reassigned. A higher value means that low count centers are more
        easily reassigned, which means that the model will take longer to
        converge, but should converge in a better clustering. However, too high
        a value may cause convergence issues, especially with a small batch
        size.

    Attributes
    ----------

    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point (if compute_labels is set to True).

    inertia_ : float
        The value of the inertia criterion associated with the chosen
        partition if compute_labels is set to True. If compute_labels is set to
        False, it's an approximation of the inertia based on an exponentially
        weighted average of the batch inertiae.

        stops.

    n_init : int (default: 1)
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different

        'random': choose k observations (rows) at random from data for the
        initial centroids.
        If an ndarray is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, ts_size, d)
        and gives the initial centers.

  """Mean shift clustering using a flat kernel.

    Mean shift clustering aims to discover "blobs" in a smooth density of

    region. These candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to
    eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

    Seeding is performed using a binning technique for scalability.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <mean_shift>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bandwidth : float, default=None
        Bandwidth used in the flat kernel.

        If not given, the bandwidth is estimated using

    min_bin_freq : int, default=1
       To speed up the algorithm, accept only those bins with at least

    cluster_all : bool, default=True
        If true, then all points are clustered, even those orphans that are
        not within any kernel. Orphans are assigned to the nearest kernel.
        If false, then orphans are given cluster label -1.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. The following tasks benefit
        from the parallelization:

        - The search of nearest neighbors for bandwidth estimation and label
          assignments. See the details in the docstring of the

        - Hill-climbing optimization for all seeds.

        See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

  """Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

    In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
    the individual clusters is highly non-convex, or more generally when
    a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
    description of the complete cluster, such as when clusters are
    nested circles on the 2D plane.

    If the affinity matrix is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method
    can be used to find normalized graph cuts [1]_, [2]_.

    When calling ``fit``, an affinity matrix is constructed using either
    a kernel function such the Gaussian (aka RBF) kernel with Euclidean
    distance ``d(X, X)``::

            np.exp(-gamma * d(X,X) ** 2)

    or a k-nearest neighbors connectivity matrix.

    Alternatively, a user-provided affinity matrix can be specified by
    setting ``affinity='precomputed'``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {'arpack', 'lobpcg', 'amg'}, default=None
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities. If None, then ``'arpack'`` is
        used. See [4]_ for more details regarding `'lobpcg'`.

    n_components : int, default=None
        Number of eigenvectors to use for the spectral embedding. If None,
        defaults to `n_clusters`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization
        of the lobpcg eigenvectors decomposition when `eigen_solver ==
        'amg'`, and for the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make
        the results deterministic across calls (See
        :term:`Glossary <random_state>`).

        .. note::
            When using `eigen_solver == 'amg'`,
            it is necessary to also fix the global numpy seed with
            `np.random.seed(int)` to get deterministic results. See
            https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg/issues/139 for further
            information.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia. Only used if
        ``assign_labels='kmeans'``.

    gamma : float, default=1.0
        Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid, laplacian and chi2 kernels.
        Ignored for ``affinity='nearest_neighbors'``.

    affinity : str or callable, default='rbf'
        How to construct the affinity matrix.
         - 'nearest_neighbors': construct the affinity matrix by computing a
           graph of nearest neighbors.
         - 'rbf': construct the affinity matrix using a radial basis function
           (RBF) kernel.
         - 'precomputed': interpret ``X`` as a precomputed affinity matrix,
           where larger values indicate greater similarity between instances.
         - 'precomputed_nearest_neighbors': interpret ``X`` as a sparse graph
           of precomputed distances, and construct a binary affinity matrix
           from the ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors of each instance.
         - one of the kernels supported by
           :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels`.

        Only kernels that produce similarity scores (non-negative values that
        increase with similarity) should be used. This property is not checked
        by the clustering algorithm.

    n_neighbors : int, default=10
        Number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix using
        the nearest neighbors method. Ignored for ``affinity='rbf'``.

    eigen_tol : float, default="auto"
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix.
        If `eigen_tol="auto"` then the passed tolerance will depend on the
        `eigen_solver`:

        - If `eigen_solver="arpack"`, then `eigen_tol=0.0`;
        - If `eigen_solver="lobpcg"` or `eigen_solver="amg"`, then
          `eigen_tol=None` which configures the underlying `lobpcg` solver to
          automatically resolve the value according to their heuristics. See,
          :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lobpcg` for details.

        Note that when using `eigen_solver="lobpcg"` or `eigen_solver="amg"`
        values of `tol<1e-5` may lead to convergence issues and should be
        avoided.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           Added 'auto' option.

    assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize', 'cluster_qr'}, default='kmeans'
        The strategy for assigning labels in the embedding space. There are two
        ways to assign labels after the Laplacian embedding. k-means is a
        popular choice, but it can be sensitive to initialization.
        Discretization is another approach which is less sensitive to random
        initialization [3]_.
        The cluster_qr method [5]_ directly extract clusters from eigenvectors
        in spectral clustering. In contrast to k-means and discretization, cluster_qr
        has no tuning parameters and runs no iterations, yet may outperform
        k-means and discretization in terms of both quality and speed.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
           Added new labeling method 'cluster_qr'.

    degree : float, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : dict of str to any, default=None
        Parameters (keyword arguments) and values for kernel passed as
        callable object. Ignored by other kernels.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run when `affinity='nearest_neighbors'`
        or `affinity='precomputed_nearest_neighbors'`. The neighbors search
        will be done in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

  """
    Agglomerative Clustering.

    Recursively merges pair of clusters of sample data; uses linkage distance.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <hierarchical_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int or None, default=2
        The number of clusters to find. It must be ``None`` if
        ``distance_threshold`` is not ``None``.

    affinity : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` for
        its metric parameter.
        If linkage is "ward", only "euclidean" is accepted.
        If "precomputed", a distance matrix (instead of a similarity matrix)
        is needed as input for the fit method.

        .. deprecated:: 1.2
            `affinity` was deprecated in version 1.2 and will be renamed to
            `metric` in 1.4.

    metric : str or callable, default=None
        Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be "euclidean", "l1", "l2",
        "manhattan", "cosine", or "precomputed". If set to `None` then
        "euclidean" is used. If linkage is "ward", only "euclidean" is
        accepted. If "precomputed", a distance matrix is needed as input for
        the fit method.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.
        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the
        path to the caching directory.

    connectivity : array-like or callable, default=None
        Connectivity matrix. Defines for each sample the neighboring
        samples following a given structure of the data.
        This can be a connectivity matrix itself or a callable that transforms
        the data into a connectivity matrix, such as derived from
        `kneighbors_graph`. Default is ``None``, i.e, the
        hierarchical clustering algorithm is unstructured.

    compute_full_tree : 'auto' or bool, default='auto'
        Stop early the construction of the tree at ``n_clusters``. This is
        useful to decrease computation time if the number of clusters is not
        small compared to the number of samples. This option is useful only
        when specifying a connectivity matrix. Note also that when varying the
        number of clusters and using caching, it may be advantageous to compute
        the full tree. It must be ``True`` if ``distance_threshold`` is not
        ``None``. By default `compute_full_tree` is "auto", which is equivalent
        to `True` when `distance_threshold` is not `None` or that `n_clusters`
        is inferior to the maximum between 100 or `0.02 * n_samples`.
        Otherwise, "auto" is equivalent to `False`.

    linkage : {'ward', 'complete', 'average', 'single'}, default='ward'
        Which linkage criterion to use. The linkage criterion determines which
        distance to use between sets of observation. The algorithm will merge
        the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.

        - 'ward' minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
        - 'average' uses the average of the distances of each observation of
          the two sets.
        - 'complete' or 'maximum' linkage uses the maximum distances between
          all observations of the two sets.
        - 'single' uses the minimum of the distances between all observations
          of the two sets.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added the 'single' option

    distance_threshold : float, default=None
        The linkage distance threshold at or above which clusters will not be
        merged. If not ``None``, ``n_clusters`` must be ``None`` and
        ``compute_full_tree`` must be ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.21

    compute_distances : bool, default=False
        Computes distances between clusters even if `distance_threshold` is not
        used. This can be used to make dendrogram visualization, but introduces
        a computational and memory overhead.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_clusters_ : int
        The number of clusters found by the algorithm. If
        ``distance_threshold=None``, it will be equal to the given
        ``n_clusters``.

        Cluster labels for each point.

    n_leaves_ : int
        Number of leaves in the hierarchical tree.

  """Estimate clustering structure from vector array.

    OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure), closely
    related to DBSCAN, finds core sample of high density and expands clusters
    from them [1]_. Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable
    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the
    current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.

    Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method
    (cluster_method = 'dbscan') or an automatic
    technique proposed in [1]_ (cluster_method = 'xi').

    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing
    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then
    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the
    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion
    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_samples : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=5
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as
        a core point. Also, up and down steep regions can't have more than
        ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an absolute
        number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least
        2).

    max_eps : float, default=np.inf
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as
        in the neighborhood of the other. Default value of ``np.inf`` will
        identify clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result
        in shorter run times.

    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn
        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.

        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the
        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is
        "precomputed", `X` is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be
        square.

        Valid values for metric are:

        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']

        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',
          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',
          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',
          'yule']

        Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.
        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
        metrics.

        .. note::
           `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will removed in SciPy 1.11.

    p : float, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    cluster_method : str, default='xi'
        The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated
        reachability and ordering. Possible values are "xi" and "dbscan".

    eps : float, default=None
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as
        in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value
        as ``max_eps``.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.

    xi : float between 0 and 1, default=0.05
        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that
        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the
        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its
        successor being at most 1-xi.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    predecessor_correction : bool, default=True
        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS
        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be
        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`.
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`.
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate
          algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.
        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the
        path to the caching directory.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().
        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster
        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.

    reachability_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use
        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    ordering_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.

    core_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object
        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use
        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    predecessor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.
        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.

    cluster_hierarchy_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)
        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with
        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to
        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing
        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does
        not reflect the hierarchy, usually
        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also
        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.
        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.
        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings. """
