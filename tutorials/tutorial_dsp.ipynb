        "\n",
        "   The Butterworth filter is a popular linear filter designed to pass signals within a specified frequency range while attenuating frequencies outside that range. It is characterized by **a smooth frequency response** and is commonly used in signal processing and communications. Mathematically, the filter transfer function is given by $H(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\frac{s}{\\omega_c})^{2n}}$ where $s$ is the complex frequency variable, $\\omega_c$ is the cutoff frequency, and $n$ is the filter order.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"order\" parameter in a Butterworth filter specifies the filter's degree. It determines the filter's frequency response characteristics, affecting its cutoff frequency and slope. Higher orders result in steeper cutoffs, effectively filtering out frequencies beyond the desired range. Lower orders have wider transition regions but lower phase distortion. The choice of order balances filter performance and computational complexity based on specific application requirements."

        "**Phase Response:**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "A moving average filter is a simple and widely used signal processing technique that smooths out fluctuations or noise in data by averaging a sliding window of values from the input data over time. It's commonly used in time series data, such as stock prices, sensor readings, or audio signals, to help highlight trends or patterns by reducing short-term variations.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define window size:** This is the number of consecutive data points considered at a time. For example, in a moving average with a window size of 3, each value in the output is the average of the previous three data points from the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Slide the window across the data:** For each point in the data, the window shifts one position forward, and a new average is calculated for the new set of data points within the window.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output:** The result is a smoother version of the input data, where the short-term fluctuations are reduced.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Simplicity:** Moving average filters are easy to implement and understand. They involve simple arithmetic (averaging) and are computationally inexpensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Noise Reduction:** These filters are effective at removing random noise, especially in cases where the noise is high-frequency, making the signal smoother.\n",

        "3. **Stability:** They are stable and do not introduce any complex artifacts. The output is typically smooth, which is useful for many applications like signal filtering or trend analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Effective for Low-Frequency Signals:** Moving averages are well-suited to data that exhibits low-frequency variations or trends, as they preserve the signal while removing rapid fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Widely Used:** They are commonly used in various fields such as stock market analysis (e.g., moving average of stock prices), sensor data smoothing, and image processing (e.g., blurring).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Delay/Phase Shift:** Moving average filters introduce a delay in the signal, especially for long window sizes. This is problematic for real-time systems or time-sensitive applications. The output may lag behind the actual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loss of High-Frequency Information:** These filters can attenuate high-frequency signals or rapid changes in data, which may be undesirable in applications that require preserving sharp transitions (e.g., edge detection in images).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Window Size Sensitivity:** The performance of a moving average filter heavily depends on the window size. A too-small window might not filter enough noise, while a too-large window may overly smooth the signal, losing important details.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Edge Effects:** For data at the boundaries (e.g., the start or end of a time series or image), moving averages may produce unreliable results because the filter may not have enough data points on one side of the window.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Not Ideal for Non-Stationary Data:** Moving average filters are better suited for stationary or slow-varying signals. They may not perform well with non-stationary signals (i.e., signals that have trends or abrupt changes).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Over-Smoothing:** In some cases, particularly with larger window sizes, the filter can over-smooth the signal, removing important variations or trends in the data."

By transforming the signal into the frequency domain, one can selectively remove or attenuate specific frequency bands associated with noise. Mathematically, denoising is achieved by zeroing or attenuating certain frequency components in the Fourier-transformed signal, followed by an inverse FFT to obtain the denoised signal.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** is a similarity measure between two temporal sequences, accommodating for variations in their alignment and speed. It finds an optimal warping path by minimizing the accumulated distance between corresponding points.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, given sequences $ A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$ and $B = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]$, DTW constructs a cost matrix $C$ where $C(i, j)$ represents the local distance between $a_i$ and $b_j$.  It then calculates an optimal path from $C(1, 1)$ to $ C(n, m)$ through dynamic programming. DTW is widely used in pattern recognition, speech processing, and signal analysis for aligning time series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Non-linear Alignment:** DTW can align sequences that have varying speeds. For example, it can compare two sequences where one sequence is \"stretched\" or \"compressed\" relative to the other (e.g., a faster and slower version of the same movement or event).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Time Warping:** The idea of warping comes from adjusting the time axis in such a way that corresponding points in the two sequences match as well as possible. This is done by considering all possible alignments of the two sequences, even if they are of different lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Distance Measure:** DTW computes the distance between two time series by considering each point in one series and finding the optimal match (with a possible shift) in the other series. The total distance is the sum of these optimal matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cost Matrix:** DTW uses a cost matrix to evaluate the alignment between the two sequences. This matrix measures the \"cost\" of aligning different points from each sequence. It is calculated by comparing each pair of points from the two sequences and computing the difference between them (often squared differences).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Recursive Calculation:** The cost matrix is filled recursively, where each cell contains the minimal cumulative distance required to reach that point from the start of the sequences. The cumulative cost is the sum of the cost to reach the current point and the minimum of the previous possible alignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimal Path:** The final DTW distance is obtained by tracing back from the end of the cost matrix to the start. This path represents the optimal alignment between the two sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Warping Path:** The warping path describes how the points in one sequence correspond to the points in the other sequence. It allows one sequence to be \"warped\" (or stretched/compressed) to align with the other."

        "\n",
        "The **Non-Linear Adaptive Averaging Function (NLAAF)** is a signal processing technique designed to improve the quality of a signal by adaptively adjusting how averaging is applied based on the characteristics of the signal itself. Unlike simple linear averaging methods (such as moving average filters), which apply the same weight or averaging function to all data points, NLAAF adjusts the averaging process dynamically according to the local behavior or properties of the signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The idea behind NLAAF is to use local signal characteristics to determine how much averaging should be applied at each point in the signal. For example, at regions where the signal changes rapidly (edges or transitions), the averaging might be reduced or avoided, so the filter does not blur important features. In regions where the signal is more uniform or contains noise, stronger smoothing or averaging is applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The non-linear nature of the filter allows it to better handle complex signals with noise and varying levels of smoothness, making it more adaptable and capable of preserving important features compared to traditional linear filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Non-Linear:** NLAAF is a non-linear filter, meaning that it doesn't apply a linear weighting to each data point in the signal. Instead, the function may apply a more complex, non-linear operation to smooth the signal while preserving important features like edges or rapid transitions that a linear filter might blur or distort.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Adaptive:** The term \"adaptive\" means that the filter adjusts itself to the characteristics of the data. For example, it might apply stronger smoothing where the signal is relatively stable and less smoothing where the signal changes rapidly. This is important when dealing with signals that contain both noise and sharp transitions, as it can help preserve the important parts of the signal while reducing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Averaging Function:** Averaging refers to combining multiple data points in some way to produce a smoothed value. In NLAAF, this function is not fixed or uniform across the entire signal, but changes depending on the local context of the signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "</br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** There are two NLAAF function in this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **NLAAF 1** - Applies DTW to two small windows (pieces) and determines the average of the pieces. These averages are used to build a center piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **NLAAF 2** - same as NLAAF 1, except a specified number of pieces greater than 2 are used to build the center piece.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Iterative Constrained Dynamic Time Warping (ICDTW)** is an enhanced version of the standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, designed to address some of the limitations of DTW, especially in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy when comparing time series with similar patterns but differing temporal alignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**FEATURES:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Iterative Approach:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* ICDTW modifies the standard DTW algorithm by iteratively refining the alignment between two time series. Instead of computing the DTW distance in a single pass, ICDTW takes an iterative approach, adjusting the alignment progressively.\n",
        "\n",
        "* During each iteration, constraints are applied to limit the warping path and force the algorithm to focus on specific parts of the time series. This helps to improve the accuracy of the alignment by preventing excessive warping in regions where it may not be necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Constrained Path:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* One of the main advantages of ICDTW over standard DTW is that it applies constraints to the warping path. These constraints limit how much the time series can be \"stretched\" or \"compressed\" along the time axis. By doing so, ICDTW restricts the amount of warping to more reasonable bounds, preventing overfitting to noise or small variations that could distort the alignment.\n",

        "* **Preserving Important Features:** The application of constraints during the iterative process helps to prevent the alignment from distorting important features in the time series, such as sharp transitions or edges. This is especially useful in time series that contain noise or irregularities.\n",

        "\n",
        "**DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA)** is a technique used to compute an average of multiple time series using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Unlike traditional methods of averaging time series, which simply compute the mean of corresponding points, DBAs use DTW to align the time series before averaging. This allows for the averaging of time series that may have temporal misalignments, speed variations, or shifts. The primary goal of DBA is to find a central tendency or \"average\" time series that best represents a set of input time series, while accounting for non-linear alignments in the data.\n",

        "* **Barycenter:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The term \"barycenter\" refers to the center of mass or average of a set of data points. In the context of DBA, the barycenter represents an average time series, which is computed by iteratively aligning and averaging multiple time series.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Averaging of Time Series**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Traditional averaging of time series simply computes the average of each corresponding time point across all series. However, this approach does not work well when time series are not perfectly aligned.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * DTW Barycenter Averaging solves this by aligning the time series first and then computing a pointwise average of the aligned sequences."

        "\n",
        "**1. Initialization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the barycenter, which can be any of the input time series or some other starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Iterative Process:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * In each iteration, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "    **1. Alignment using DTW:** For each time series in the dataset, the DTW algorithm is used to align that series with the current barycenter. This ensures that corresponding points in each time series are matched optimally, despite any differences in time or speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **2. Averaging:** After aligning the time series, the average of all the aligned time series is computed at each time point, creating a new candidate barycenter.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Convergence:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The process is repeated iteratively. In each iteration, the barycenter is updated, and the DTW alignment is recomputed. The algorithm converges when the barycenter stops changing significantly between iterations or after a pre-defined number of iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Final Barycenter:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The final output of the algorithm is a time series that represents the average (or barycenter) of the input time series. This series is aligned in a way that best captures the common underlying pattern of the input sequences."

        "\n",
        "**1. Handling Temporal Misalignments:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * DBA excels in scenarios where the input time series are misaligned or have different lengths, which is common in many real-world applications (e.g., speech, motion tracking). By using DTW to align the series first, DBA can compute a meaningful average despite these misalignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Robustness to Noise:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Since DBA aligns the time series before averaging, it tends to be more robust to noise than traditional averaging methods. By aligning the time series, DBA reduces the impact of small fluctuations that may not represent the true underlying patterns.\n",

        "**3. Flexible for Variable Length Time Series:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * One of the key benefits of DBA is its ability to handle time series of different lengths. Traditional averaging methods require the series to be of equal length, but DBA can work with series of varying lengths by aligning them first.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Improved Pattern Recognition:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * DBA can produce more accurate representations of a group of time series, making it useful for pattern recognition tasks. The barycenter obtained through DTW alignment can better represent the shared characteristics of the input time series."

It decomposes a time series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which represent different oscillatory modes of the data. These IMFs are derived from the data itself, without relying on a pre-defined basis, making EMD particularly useful for analyzing complex, real-world signals that do not follow simple trends or seasonality.\n",

This makes it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications where the underlying signal changes over time."

The key assumption is that the sources are statistically independent, which allows ICA to effectively separate them. Mathematically, given a matrix $ $ representing the observed mixtures, ICA seeks a demixing matrix $ W $ such that $ S = WX $, where $ S $ contains the estimated source signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimization problem in ICA is often formulated as maximizing the non-Gaussianity of the estimated sources. One common approach uses negentropy as a measure of non-Gaussianity, leading to objective functions like:\n",

To minimize the impact of Frequency Leakage, the original signal can be multiplied by a window function. After framing, we get many framed segment.

        "PCT is a signal processing technique and a variant of the Chirplet Transform. The Chirplet Transform is a method used to analyze non-stationary modulations in signals, and PCT further introduces polynomial functions to enhance its analytical capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Chirplet Transform, \"Chirp\" refers to a signal with a frequency that varies over time, and a \"Chirplet\" is a wavelet associated with a Chirp. PCT introduces polynomial modulation functions, allowing the frequency, phase, and amplitude of Chirplets to vary according to the shape of the polynomial.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of PCT is to use polynomials to describe the nonlinear modulation characteristics of a signal, thereby better capturing the complex structures and non-stationary nature of the signal. This method is effective for analyzing signals where frequency, phase, and amplitude change over time."
